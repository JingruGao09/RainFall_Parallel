# RainFall_Parallel
### Simulation of rain fall and apply parallelism
  1. Complete the neighbors configuration
  2. Complete traversal and correctly output the absorbtion matrix


### TO DO:
  1. Seq Code is extremely slow. 100 times slower than example output file.
  2. Parallelism to improve the performance.

## The Project is complete, new version need to be uploaded.
